# about me
I am <span class="p-name">justin threlkeld</span>, a researcher, strategist, and [person](/humans.txt) who tends to find himself designing systems for learning together. I occasionally describe what I do as "planting knowledge gardens at scale."

I've led, participated in, and helped establish research practices for Large Companies and considerably smaller startups. My work centers on elevating the way people learn together. I frequently use metaphors like "a trail guide for understanding" — mix of connecting people with the tools and know-how to get insight for themselves, leading groups through a forest of information to build understanding together, and sometimes going off on my own to find the knowledge we need at the bottom of some dark cave while the rest of the group stays focused on other things.

Like most trail guides, I've got certain areas where I've build up a wealth of experience, having spent a lot of time walking around problem territories like
- Developer experience: what makes good software difficult to produce and maintain? What might we do about that?
- Technology and society: how are tools, technology, and culture intertwined? How do cultural practices change in response to new tools?
- Expert workflows: how do expert practitioners (whether office workers, construction crews, hospital staff, or otherwise) approach their work? How might these workflows be improved?
- Incidents, crises, and disaster: how do systems fail and how does system scale impact failure modes? How do people respond to (and recover from) system failures? How can we mitigate or prepare for catastrophe?

When I'm not working in these areas, I am often still thinking about them. My hobbies include outdoor adventures, a wide variety of games mostly centered on the apocalyptic, self-hosting computer infrastructure. I am based in Denver, Colorado.
